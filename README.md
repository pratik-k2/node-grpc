# Tutorial of a CRUD with gRPC and Node

This project is separated in two parts:
- Server: where gRPC serves the remote calls defined in the proto file
- Index: Express/Node/Bootstrap web page to CRUD the server operations.

In order to run this app, issue in separate command line windows:
- Inside application root: `node server.js`
- Inside application root: `node index.js`
- Use curls from curl.sh files to access APIs
